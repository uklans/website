altLAN started out running small gatherings off the back of the now defunct MatureGaming.com community, Primarily Xbox 360s, in homes, and then village halls. The organisers teamed up to create altLAN, with the aim being that it was more a celebration of gaming culture, than a straight up LAN.

We run small events throughout the weekend, on stage and in breakout areas, with plenty of 'just for a laugh' leaderboards and ladders.
